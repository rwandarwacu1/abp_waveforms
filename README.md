# abp_waveforms
abp_waveforms is an R package for arterial blood pressure (ABP), ECG, and PPG waveform analysis. It provides fast Rcpp-backed functions and R utilities for fiducial point detection (foot, peak, dicrotic notch), feature extraction (pulse pressure, AIx, RWTT, PAT, etc.), and visualization, enabling reproducible research and comparisons.
